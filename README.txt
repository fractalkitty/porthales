I am Sophia Wood (Fractal Kitty) and I did this just for fun and community creativity.

I used the following (I may do a write up if there is interest):

Storm manhole data from the City of Salem, OR
p5js code for initial prototype
Python along with multiple libraries including pandas, folium, numpi/scipi, etc.
Glitch for hosting the map.
GitHub for hosting the code.
ChatGPT 4 for debugging and chat for css, python, and html. (this was my first use of pandas a folium)
