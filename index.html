      <p>
        In the city of Salem, something mysterious is going on. There appears to
        be a change in the ~10,000 manholes that line our streets. They seem to
        have transformed into portals with a destination, a code name, and a
        risk level.

      <p>
        Is this a porthole or a portal? It's a 'porthale' (both). You decide
        whether to glimpse or transport your imagination into these realms. I
        encourage you to write, wax poetic, discuss, and imagine. As you walk,
        what do you ponder?

      Notes: The inner ellipse (click on the layers) has ~68% of the manholes, the middle has ~95%, and the
      outer has ~99.7%. The centroid of these portals is at the center of the
      ellipses.
